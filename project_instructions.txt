README:

For our project we're asking you to review a Turker's work that was rejected and judge whether or not the rejection was fair. 

To make contributions to our project, go on MechanicalTurk Sandbox and look for the HITs "Sentiment Analysis" and "Review HIT Appeals". (requester Mukund Venkateswaran).

There are two styles of HITs, one that includes the reason for appealing from a worker, and one that does not. The original HIT itself is taken from Jie's work on attribute-adjective matching that we used in Homework 7. We ask you to complete a couple quality control questions before and then you can review the worker's work that was rejected and hand down your judgement. Please complete both HITs. 

If something does not work, please send an email to:
