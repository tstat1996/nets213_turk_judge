## Components 
* Collect images of cars from the web. Work required: 2. Our ideas so far are: 

	1. An image clearly with a car
	2. An image clearly without a car
	3. An image that may have a car in the corner	
	4. A blurry image
	5. A cartoon car
	6. A truck 
* Write up appeals for each image. Work required: 3 Our ideas so far are (numbered corresponding to the image list above):
	1. (a) "I said there is a car and there clearly is" (b) I misclicked that there is not a car.
	2. (a) "I said there is not a car there clearly is not" (b) I misclicked that there is a car.
	3. (a) "That tire and hood in the corner looks like a car" (b) "That tire and hood is not an entire car" (c) "The instructions were not clear on whether it needed to be a full car"
	4. (a) "The image was too blurry to tell"
	5. (a) "The instructions did not specify whether cartoon cars count" Works for both yes/no
	6. (a) "The isntructions did not specify whether trucks count" Works for both yes/no
* Quality Control. We will limit this to workers with approval rating > 90%, workers who did not write the appeal, and workers who have completed > 100 HITS. We may or may not tell the judges this information when they review the appeal. We can also implement some ethical questions survey before the workers judge the appeal to do quality control, or have an idea of the baseline of who is voting on the appeals. Work required: 1
* Crowdsourcing the judgement on the appeals on Mechanical Turk at 3 different pay levels: 1 cent, 5 cents, and 10 cents. We will publish each type of appeal, one where the worker got rejected for a right answer and one where the worker got rejected for a wrong answer. Each individual appeals receives its judgement after it has been voted on by 5 workers (could be another number). Work required: 4
* Aggregation Control. We will collect the results for each payment amount by majority vote and weighted majority vote. Potentially will also do a unanimous vote check to try to simulate an actual jury. Work required: 4.
* Analyzing the results. We will judge whether there is a difference in the voting/honesty of workers based on how much they are being paid to judge the appeal. We will also analyze whether there is a tendency for workers to side with otehr workers for getting paid. Work required: 4.
